Multi Donate
==============

Allows donors to select from a group of candidates and automatically donate to them. Either at the maximum amount or for a chosen amount less than that.

This utilizes Flask and MongoDB on Heroku. To be even more web-hipster, it uses jQuery and Modernizr and Bootstrap for the frontend.

This owes a lot to Flask-Template and  zachwill's [flask_heroku](https://github.com/zachwill/flask_heroku), but it's not properly a fork of it.
