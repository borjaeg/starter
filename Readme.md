Flask Template
==============

This is just a template for Flask and MongoDB projects on Heroku. To be even more web-hipster, it uses jQuery and Modernizr and Bootstrap for the frontend.

This owes a lot to zachwill's [flask_heroku](https://github.com/zachwill/flask_heroku), but it's not properly a fork of it.
